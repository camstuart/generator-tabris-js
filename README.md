# Tabris.js generator

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for [Tabris.js](https://tabrisjs.com/) apps. It lets you quickly set up a new project with sensible defaults and best practices.

## Getting Started

Install yeoman, this generator, and an HTTP server for local testing:

```js
npm install -g yo generator-tabris-js http-server
```

Create your app in an empty directory:

```js
yo tabris-js
```

Run the app locally:

```
npm start
```

Get the [Tabris.js Developer App](https://tabrisjs.com/download) and point it to the URL the HTTP server has just opened (should be printed on the console).
